## Don't Pay for Noise: Strategic Traffic Management to Slash Your Cloud Bills

### Abstract

Is your cloud bill spiraling out of control? The culprit might not be your application's code, but the traffic hitting it. With nearly 50% of all internet traffic now automated, a significant portion of your infrastructure costs are spent serving "noise." This is no longer just simple scripts; we're now facing sophisticated AI agents and reasoning models used for everything from competitive price scraping to large-scale data extraction for training LLMs. These agents use residential proxy networks to bypass geoblocking and rate limits, making their traffic indistinguishable from your real customers and driving up your cloud bill with every request.

This session dives into the discipline of traffic management, moving beyond basic security to focus on its profound financial and operational impact. We'll explore why traditional defenses like IP blocklists and basic WAFs are failing against this new wave of AI-driven threats that leverage anti-detect browsers and residential proxies. You'll learn how to gain true visibility into your traffic, distinguish valuable users from costly automated agents, and implement effective control strategies at the edge.

Join us to discover how a proactive approach to traffic management can not only enhance your security posture but also eliminate the unseen costs of bot traffic—like skewed analytics and wasted engineering cycles—to deliver a direct and significant reduction in your infrastructure and cloud spending.

### What You Will Learn

#### The Financial Impact of AI Agents

Learn how sophisticated AI scrapers and autonomous agents are directly inflating your cloud costs by consuming bandwidth, triggering autoscaling, and straining your origin servers.

#### The Unseen Costs of Bot Traffic

Understand the flow-on effects you may not have considered, such as corrupted A/B test results, skewed analytics leading to poor business decisions, and wasted developer time chasing performance issues caused by bots.

#### How to Identify Modern Threats

Understand why traditional IP reputation services are failing and how AI agents leverage residential proxy networks and anti-detect browsers to bypass your existing security, making them invisible to conventional tools.

#### Actionable Defense Strategies

Discover the top three strategies to counter these threats: advanced rate limiting using network fingerprints (TLS/HTTP2), intelligent bot management that identifies automation patterns, and strategic edge caching to shield your infrastructure.

#### A Framework for Cost Reduction

Walk away with a practical framework for implementing traffic management that can significantly reduce your origin server load and deliver a measurable decrease in your cloud bill, backed by real-world case study data.

### Target Audience

DevOps Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), Cloud Architects, and IT Managers responsible for infrastructure and cloud budgets. CTOs and VPs of Engineering looking for strategies to optimise operational costs. 

### Speaker Bio

Adam Cassar is an infrastructure and platform architect with over two decades of experience building and scaling innovative online businesses. As Co-Founder and Head of Security Engineering at Peakhour.io, he leads the development of the company's integrated platform, focusing on the critical intersection of performance, reliability, and security.

Drawing on his background as CTO of Australia's largest hosting provider, Netregistry, Adam has a deep, hands-on understanding of large-scale infrastructure. He specialised in designing high-availability cloud platforms and automating the management of complex systems, giving him a unique perspective on the operational challenges modern applications face.

At Peakhour, his work centers on solving these challenges at the edge. He has driven the implementation of advanced anomaly detection and network fingerprinting not just for threat mitigation, but for intelligent traffic management that reduces infrastructure load and optimises cloud costs. This approach ensures that security enhances performance, rather than degrading it.

A frequent author, Adam shares his insights on the evolving web landscape, from the practical application of performance optimization techniques like advanced caching and load balancing to the future of an internet where managing AI agents is a core operational requirement. His focus is on building resilient, efficient, and secure platforms that deliver tangible business outcomes.
