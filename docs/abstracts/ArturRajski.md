## Implementing custom rate limiting with Istio
### Abstract
I'd like to demonstrate how to implement a pretty flexible rate limiting solution that integrates directly with Istio service mesh on Kubernetes. No third party services, no downtime and no long YAML driven deployments. We'll talk about challenges with the current solutions, talk about pros and cons of this approach and do a quick demo.
