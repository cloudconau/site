## Unseen Risks: A Security Founder’s View of Cloud, AI, and the Gaps That Still Hurt Us

### Abstract
Cloud security was (is?) broken - and not for the reasons you think. Avi Shua, Co-Founder of Orca Security, shares how his experience as a security leader led him to challenge the status quo and rethink how we secure modern cloud environments. This session blends the personal journey of building Orca with exclusive insights from the 2025 State of Cloud Security Report, highlighting the most dangerous (and often overlooked) gaps between security and engineering teams.

Avi will also explore the rapid rise of AI in the cloud - what new risks it introduces, which ones are merely old threats in disguise, and how security teams must adapt. Expect a frank, data-driven look at why organizations still get breached and what must change to build truly resilient cloud infrastructure.
