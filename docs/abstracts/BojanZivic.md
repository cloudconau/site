## From Failure to Success: Architecting Away Cloud Native Anti-Patterns
### Abstract
Many organizations struggle with their cloud-native transformations. Applications break unexpectedly, costs spiral out of control, security gaps emerge, and teams become frustrated with complex deployments. The issue isn't the technology, it's the anti-patterns we unknowingly build into our systems.

In this session, drawing from real-world examples in ""Cloud Native Anti-Patterns,"" you'll discover:

#### Pattern Recognition:

How to identify the most damaging anti-patterns in cloud native architectures
Early warning signs that predict system failures

#### Practical Refactoring Strategies:

Approaches to migrate from anti-patterns to best practices
Governance models that prevent anti-patterns from emerging

#### Building Anti-Pattern-Resistant Systems

Observability patterns that catch problems before they cascade
Deployment strategies that minimize blast radius
Cultural shifts needed to sustain cloud native success
