## Our Journey in AI Platform Engineering

### Abstract
AI Platform Engineering project provides a customizable, secure, enterprise-ready, and cloud deployable reference multi-agent system that streamlines platform operations through persona-driven “usecase agents” such as Platform Engineer, Incident Engineer, and Product Owner etc. Each usecase agent is empowered by a set of specialized sub-agents that integrate seamlessly with essential engineering tools. Below are some common platform agents leveraged by the persona agents:

* ArgoCD Agent for continuous deployment
* PagerDuty Agent for incident management
* GitHub Agent for version control
* Jira Agent for project management
* Slack Agent for team communication
* ...and many more platform agents are available for additional tools and use cases.

Together, these sub-agents enable users to perform complex operations using agentic workflows by invoking relavant APIs using MCP tools. The system also includes:

**A curated prompt library**

A carefully evaluated collection of prompts designed for high accuracy and optimal workflow performance in multi-agent systems. These prompts guide persona agents (such as "Platform Engineer" or "Incident Engineer") using standardized instructions and questions, ensuring effective collaboration, incident response, platform operations, and knowledge sharing.

**Multiple End-user interfaces**

Easily invoke agentic workflows programmatically using standard A2A protocol or through intuitive UIs, enabling seamless integration with existing systems like Backstage (Internal Developer Portals).

**End-to-end security**
Secure agentic communication and task execution across all agents, ensuring API RBACs to meet enterprise requirements.

**Enterprise-ready cloud deployment architecture**
Reference deployment patterns for scalable, secure, and resilient multi-agent systems in cloud and hybrid environments
