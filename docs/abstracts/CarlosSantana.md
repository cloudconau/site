## Argo at Enterprise Scale: Automating Hundreds of Cluster Deployments with GitOps
### Abstract
In order to manage a Kubernetes fleet of clusters Kubernetes enterprise end users has embraced GitOps at a massive scale. Leveraging Cluster API (CAPI), Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), Argo CD, Argo Workflows, Prometheus and other Kubernetes controllers, fleet management was changed from a heavy burden to a tactical advantage.

This talk covers what are top learnings of using GitOps in a way that is able to be used in production across a large organization, integrating CNCF projects have helped them scale the operations with a relatively small staff of engineers. Youâ€™ll see how through an exclusively open source toolchain end users are able to deploy thousands of changes a month, safely, securely, and with confidence.
