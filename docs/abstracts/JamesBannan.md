## The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search: 30 Years of Citizen Science

### Abstract:
"Asymmetric key encryption, the primary backbone of modern secure communication, is built on the foundation of a mathematical function which is as difficult as possible to reverse - namely, the ability to describe a very large integer as a factor of two prime numbers. The larger the primes, the more resistant the encryption is to brute-force attacks and advancements in computing power, including quantum threats. This presentation explores the role of large primes in cryptography, the role of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search in looking for the next verified prime, and how you can take part.

**Key Takeaways & Learnings:**
- Understanding why large prime numbers are essential for encryption security.
- How asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) relies on the difficulty of prime factorization.
- The challenges in generating large primes and their role in cryptographic strength.
- The future of encryption with advancements in quantum computing and prime number research."
