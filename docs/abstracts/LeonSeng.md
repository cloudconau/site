## Gateway API - 5 things about the future of Ingress, in 5
### Abstract
While there are many mature Kubernetes deployments out there, many are not aware of the fact that Ingress API has been frozen for almost 2 years, as well as the existence of Gateway API as the eventual replacement.

Purpose of this talk is to give a TLDR on Gateway API, empowering practitioners to give Gateway API a closer look and understand the changes to managing traffic in and out of Kubernetes clusters, brought by the Ingress replacement.

Key takeaways:
- What is Gateway API and why
- Who and why should one care
- Initiatives around Gateway API
- Migration considerations and transition steps
