## Gateway API - 5 things about the future of Ingress, in 5
### Abstract
While there are many mature Kubernetes deployments out there, many are not aware of the fact that Ingress API has been frozen for almost 2 years, as well as the existence of Gateway API as the eventual replacement.

Purpose of this talk is to give a TLDR on Gateway API, empowering practitioners to give Gateway API a closer look and understand the changes to managing traffic in and out of Kubernetes clusters, brought by the Ingress replacement.

#### What is Gateway API and why
Eventual replacement for Ingress

#### Who and why should you care
Things to be aware of as platform engineering team or app developers
Experience with adding new features via annotation
Impacts, changes in workflows

#### What is missing vs Ingress
Not everything is sunshine and roses, not all features have been/or will be carried over

#### What other initiatives around Gateway API
- GAMMA
- Inference extension

#### How to make the transition
Implementations
Experimenting by deploying side by side with ingress controller
migration tool - ingress2gateway
