## AI-Powered Platform Engineering: Lessons from Octopus
### Abstract
Platform engineering has emerged as a critical discipline for organizations seeking to streamline their development workflows and enhance developer experience. This talk builds on the concepts presented in the book DevEx as a Service to show how Octopus integrated artificial intelligence into its platform engineering practices.

The presentation begins by establishing a clear understanding of platform engineering fundamentals and the key responsibilities that define effective platform engineering teams. We'll explore how these responsibilities naturally guide the types of solutions and tools that platform teams need to build and maintain.

The core focus shifts to AI's transformative role in modern Platform Engineering. Attendees will learn how artificial intelligence can augment traditional Platform Engineering approaches, providing out-of-the-box consistency while supporting flexible implementations.

Through real-world examples from Octopus's implementation journey, you'll discover practical strategies for incorporating AI into Platform Engineering workflows. Whether you're a platform engineer, DevOps professional, or engineering leader, this session will provide actionable insights for leveraging AI to build more efficient, reliable, and developer-friendly platforms. You'll leave with a clear roadmap for beginning or advancing your AI-enhanced Platform Engineering initiatives.

### Speaker Bio
"[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcasperson){target=_blank} have loved technology since my first Commodore 64, and that passion remains to this day. My days have me integrating enterprise platforms with Octopus, writing books on topics like DevEx and platform engineering, blogging, and training my colleagues, testing bleeding edge open source projects and contributing to various blogs.

I am a 5 star published author, and have created solutions that Red Hat felt was worthy of being submitted for a patent. CEOs endorse my development skills.

Although I am a solutions engineer by trade, I am quite comfortable implementing AI platforms, administering a Linux server, managing a MySQL database, deploying infrastructure with Terraform, reconfiguring a firewall or just doing what needs to be done to get job finished.
