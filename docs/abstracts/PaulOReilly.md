## Eating the Elephant - How to land and expand your Kubernetes knowledge for a better career.

### Abstract
"Kuberenets can be a daunting area to learn, with the infamous ""Kubernetes Iceburg"" ensuring that no matter how long you've worked with it, or what level of skill you have, imposter syndrome is always just a bad yaml file away. There's no easy way to learn all the parts, and little guidance on what's useful to learn.

I want to outline the learning pathway (from Linux, through Docker, to Kubernetes), the areas of knowledge to pick up, and the best way to learn while building up a public body of knowledge of what you know. Why? Because there's awesome jobs out there, especially with overseas companies looking to hire in our part of the world all the time! But there isn't a roadmap on how to get from hobbiest to employed, so let's start building one."
### Speaker Bio

I'm [Paul O'Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-o-reilly-tauranga/){target=_blank}, a technical expert supporting Kubernetes at scale. I've spent years managing Codefresh's global support team and I now advise enterprises both in APAC and internationally on technical best practices with Octopus Deploy.

I'm bringing that hard-won overseas knowledge back to help Aussie & NZ engineering teams avoid the pitfalls of scaling Kubernetes while embracing the tools and best practices that are proven to work. If you're ready to level up your Kubernetes game without losing your sanity, let's connect and make it happen together.
