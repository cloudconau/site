## Cloud at Speed, Security at Scale

### Abstract

Cloud adoption is accelerating, but so too are the risks. Traditional compliance models canâ€™t keep pace with cloud-native delivery, leaving organisations exposed. In this session, Rad Kanapathipillai will introduce DevOps1's Security Assurance Lifecycle Management (SALM) a framework designed to embed measurable, auditable, and continuous security into cloud engineering workflows. Attendees will learn how SALM supports frameworks such as APRA CPS 234, the Essential Eight, and ISO27001, while enabling faster, more secure delivery at scale.
