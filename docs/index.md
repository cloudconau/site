# CloudCon Sydney 2025

Join us on 9th & 10th September 2025 for CloudCon Sydney which brings together international and local experts with adopters, developers, and practitioners in an accessible and compact format. CloudCon is designed to promote face-to-face collaboration and deliver rich educational experiences. 

At the event, attendees can engage with the leaders of Kubernetes and other projects and help set direction for the cloud native ecosystem in Australia. CloudCon has both a beginner and an advanced track; about half of the speakers are international experts and half are from the local area.
